# Game guide
1. When the game begins, you will be prompted to begin a new game. Y -> continue,  n or any other key press -> exit the game.
2. If you opt to proceed, you will be asked to select a game mode: Player vs Computer.
3. Next, the console prompts the user to input the player's name.


#### Human vs Computer
The system prompts the user to choose his move from either paper, scissors, or rock as a choice.

After you've made your move, you'll see the outcome and be prompted to restart the game. 
When a game is tied, the system encourages the player to restart. A 50-round tie is officially a tie forever.
